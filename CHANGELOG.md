# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Documentation

- Quick start now says that `fixtures-dir` defaults to `fixtures` and that
  a fresh checkout has no such directory, pointing at
  `examples/protocol-28.yml` for a complete workflow; CONTRIBUTING.md
  notes that Dependabot opens its own dependency PRs under the same
  review expectations; the pull request template now prompts for an
  `[Unreleased]` entry on user-facing changes.

## [0.1.1]

### Changed

- Default `version` input bumped from `0.1.0` to `0.1.1`. Protocol-Canary
  `v0.1.1` adds `ContractExecutable` XDR type support, which 2 of the 5
  current `ProtocolCanary-Fixtures` Protocol 28 fixtures require and
  `v0.1.0` cannot parse at all. Found and closed during three-repository
  E2E validation.

### Fixed

- `parseReport` no longer rejects a schemaVersion-1 report that omits the
  `counts` field. Protocol-Canary's actual tagged `v0.1.0` release (this
  Action's pinned default) predates `counts`, so every check against it —
  even a fully passing one — was previously misreported as an execution
  failure. Found during three-repository E2E validation; `counts` is now
  derived from `results`/`skipped` when absent.

## [0.1.0]

- `stellar-canary check --format json` integration: typed input handling,
  pinned-commit installation via `cargo install --git` (no prebuilt
  release binaries exist upstream yet), safe subprocess execution with a
  configurable timeout and signal forwarding.
- GitHub job summary and annotations rendered from the CLI's own JSON
  report — never a second invocation, never a reinterpreted result.
- Optional upload of the JSON report as a `stellar-protocol-canary-report`
  workflow artifact; upload failure never changes the underlying
  compatibility result.
- Full exit-code contract support (0 pass, 1 compatibility failure, 2
  configuration error, 3 execution/RPC error, 4 invalid fixture, 5
  internal error), with a clear distinction between an execution failure
  (Canary could not run) and a compatibility failure (it ran and found a
  real problem).
- Unit and integration test suite against a mock Canary binary covering
  every documented result state; a separate, non-gating live workflow
  against a real build and Stellar Testnet.

### Known gaps

- `Protocol-Canary` does not yet publish signed/checksummed release
  binaries, so this Action builds it from a pinned source commit instead
  of downloading a verified artifact — see `SECURITY.md`.
- Only Protocol 28 has fixtures published upstream at this time.
